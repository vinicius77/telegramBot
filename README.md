## Telegram Crypto Bot

- The application should monitor the telegram group and count the number of mentions of cryptocurrency pairs (pairs = all BTC quoted pairs).

- The data must be saved in csv files by ticker (1 ticker = 1 file). In this case, the application must receive OHLCV from the exchange and also display it (five-minute timeframe).

**Implementation example:**

- BTC pairs are located on the left (1). The number to the right of the ticker indicates the number of new mentions since the last time the chart was opened. Sorting by the number of new mentions is required (:?)
- The number of mentions is displayed as a separate chart (3) along with OHLCV (2)

In addition, you need a settings window to enter API KEY and other information
